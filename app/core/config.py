----------------

Application configuration module.

Defines stronglyâ€‘typed settings loaded from the environment using
``pydantic-settings``. These settings control timeouts, retry counts
and pagination limits for HTTP operations. Having a central place for
configuration makes it easier to adjust behaviour without touching the
business logic. The values provided here are sensible defaults but can
be overridden via environment variables at deployment time.
